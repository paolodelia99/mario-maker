## Resources

Before you're want to apply your changes make you sure that, at least,
you know the basics of game dev. Especially is required that you know how 
the ECS pattern works, because this pattern is at the core of the game.

If you don't know how it works, here's there is a list resources:

- [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
- [evolve your hierarchy article](http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/)
- [redxdev/ECS docs](https://github.com/redxdev/ECS)

Indeed, If you want to learn about others design pattern/architecture which are suitable for 
game dev check out the fantastic [gameProgrammingPatterns e-book](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html).
